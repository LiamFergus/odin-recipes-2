    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 ounce (1 envelope) dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
