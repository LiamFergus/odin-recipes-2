        <h4>A Delicious Tiramisu</h4>
        <p>When a tiramisu is made correctly there are not many desserts like it. From the cocoa powder to the mascarpone cheese a real tiramisu is a real treat.</p>
    <H3>Ingredients</H3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups cold espresso</li>
            <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>8 ounce container mascarpone cheese - room temperature</li>
            <li>1 package of 'Lady Fingers' - Savoiardi brand (if available)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of coffee flavored liqueur - (Kahlua or DaVinci brands)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and mix just until combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan. </li>
            <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
            <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
        </ol>
